Aldryn Reversion
################

A collection of shared helpers and mixins to provide support for
django-reversion on models with translatable (using django-parler)
fields and/or django-cms placeholder fields.

Aldryn Reversion allows you to register your app models with django reversion
on steroids. This add-on provides tools to include placeholers, cms plugins and
translated fields into change history, which is revertable and recoverable
with just a few additional instructions.
